1. All aspects of my work have been correctly implemented:
	- JSON is parsed correctly
	- All jobs are rendered on page in the <div id="list"> section
	- of the body
	- No outputs in JavaScript console
	- No additional HTML tags inside the body
	- Each job is shown in the following order:
		 1. Company, 2. Location, 3.  Position
	- No additional HTML tags inside of the body tags

2. I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone.

3. I spent approximately 7 hours completing this assignment.

Notes:
	- I have used a stylesheet called "style.css"
	- In response to "There is something missing in the markup, 
	necessary to make your script code run on page load!", I 
	have added onload='parse()' as an attribute to my body tag
