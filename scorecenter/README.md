1. All aspects of my work have been correctly implemented:
		- collection contains only one collection named highscores
		- collection highscores stores game_title, username, score, and created_at
		- POST API /submit.json has cross-origin resource sharing and has exact field names game_title, username, and score
		- GET API /highscores.json returns the top 10 scores in descending order as a JSON string
		- /highscores.json?game_title=frogger returns the top 10 scores in descending order for the game "frogger"
		- GET API has cross-origin resource sharing
		- the root displays a list of all the scores for all games
		- /usersearch displays a list of all the high scores for all games for the specific username on a new page
		- contains README.md
		- good variable names and code indentation
		- consistent and constant Git commits and pushes
		- meaningful Git commit messages
		- non-empty .gitignore file
