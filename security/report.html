<h1>Jim Mao - Assignment 6: Security Assessment of ScoreCenter</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For Assignment 5, students were asked to create a web application 
that would represent a scorecenter for games such as the Frogger game 
in Assignment 4. This scorecenter needed to have the following 
features: a POST API called /submit.json, a GET API called /highscores.json 
a root called /, and a usersearch page called /usersearch. While the 
scorecenters do their job of keeping track of high scores for various usernames 
on various games, it is impossible to overlook the security issues that are 
present within the web application. I have been hired to analyze the web 
of classmate Nick Teleky, and will outline the security leaks that must be fixed 
before this web application is sent out for public use.</p>
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>The web application that I am analyzing can be found at 
<a href="http://nt-scorecenter.herokuapp.com/">http://nt-scorecenter.herokuapp.com/</a>. 
To test the application, I first accessed the root. After accessing the root, 
I visited <a href="http://nt-scorecenter.herokuapp.com/highscores.json"/>http://nt-scorecenter.herokuapp.com/highscores.json</a>
 and 
<a href="http://nt-scorecenter.herokuapp.com/usersearch"/>http://nt-scorecenter.herokuapp.com/usersearch</a>. 
To test security leaks, I started with trying attacks that could be performed 
without looking at the source code. Then, I opened up the source code to see whether 
there were more weak spots of the code that left it wide open to malicious users. <br/><br/>
In this report, security tools Burp Suite, OWASP WebScarab, and Paros are not used. </p>
<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>The main and most obvious issue with this scorecenter web application is that it does 
not check what it's given. It does not check whether the username entered into the usersearch 
bar is actually a real username, rather than malicious code meant to destruct the 
web applicaiton. Furthermore, it does not check whether the scores posted to the database are real scores, 
rather than just made up scores that often impossible to even obtain. Lastly, it does not put a limit 
on the username it is given in the usersearch. </p>
<h1>Issues Found</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1. Issue: Usersearch input is not validated</p>
<p>Location: /usersearch</p>
<p>Severity: High - Attacker can redirect user to harmful sites, mess with 
with the layout of the usersearch page, and create a loop of popups.</p>
<p>Description: Creator of the web application does not use any function 
to clean up the input that an attack may send. For example, see the following 
image: <br/><br/>
<img src="scriptInjection.jpg" alt="Input is not validated"/><br/><br/>
Here, the attacker has inserted the script &lt;script&gt;alert('hi');&lt;/script&gt; to 
create an annoying, meaningless pop-up.
<p>Resolution: First, store the input that the user has given. Then, use the 
jquery function <br/><br/>
$(userInput).find('script').remove() <br/><br/>
to find any scripts that the user may have entered. Now store that result and compare that result with the 
initial input. If the two strings do not match, that means the user has inserted a 
script into the usersearch bar. If this happens, notify the user that the input has 
not been accepted and if possible, the web application should note the IP address 
of the user for any potential investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2. Issue: Database insertion is not checked</p>
<p>Location: /submit.json</p>
<p>Severity: Medium - While it is somewhat scary that an attacker can post any score 
he or she wants to tamper with the high scores, it is not necessarily dangerous to 
the web application creator.</p>
<p>Description: Creator of the web application does not use any way to authenticate 
or verify that the post request coming into the database is coming from an actual 
game, rather than an attacker using a curl POST request or a jquery POST request. 
See what has happened here: <br/><br/>
<img src="databaseInjection.jpg" alt="Database injection is not checked"/><br/><br/>
The users Yo_mama and scoutfilmmaker were created by the web application creator. 
However, the users attacker and attacker1 were created by me, without even playing 
the frogger game, therefore tampering with the validity of the scores. See the image of a function I created using the jquery POST function: <br/></br>
<img src="postFromHtmlScript.jpg" alt="POST from HTML script"><br/><br/>
A post request using curl from the git bash terminal can be done with the following command: <br/><br/>
curl -F username=attacker1 -F score=5000 -F game_title=frogger nt-scorecenter.herokuapp.com/submit.json </br>
</p>
<p>Resolution: The application must have some way of making sure that the post request 
is actually coming from an actual game. For exmaple, if the user finishes a game, the game 
should give the user a key or passphrase that will allow him to enter his score into the 
database. This way, a POST request using curl or jquery will have no way of obtaining the 
key phrase and therefore no way entering its score into the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3. Issue: No limit on the length of username</p>
<p>Location: /usersearch</p>
<p>Severity: High - Because there is not cutoff for the length of username, this also leaves 
the web application wide open for script injections from attackers.</p>
<p>Description: In the following picture, it is clear that there is no length limit 
for the username entered: <br/><br/>
<img src="noUsernameLengthLimit.jpg" alt="no username length limit"><br/><br/>
Scripts can be very long and complicated. A length limit of, say, 15 characters is enough 
to prevent most sophisiticated scripts from executing. Besides, there is absolutely no 
reason why a username should be longer than 15 characters long.</p>
<p>Resolution: Use the maxlength attribute to limit the length:<br/><br/>
&lt;input type="text" name="username" maxlength="15"&gt;<br/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It is clear that many web security issues exist in the web application. If these weaknesses 
are taken advantage of, there functionality and convenience of this scorecenter application 
will be severely compromised. Annoying popups may appear and some reported scores may be false, 
making the most avid of gamers frustrated with falling short of seemingly legitimate scores.<br/><br/>
Before you make this applicaiton public, I strongly recommend that you let me help you in fixing 
this application. For a small and reasonable amount of $25, I will be able to fix this appplication 
and return it to you all set to be set out of the public.</p>
