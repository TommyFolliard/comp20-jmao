1. All aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly:
	- Messages are stored in local storage

Note: In Lab9, in displaying the latest message at the top, I had to display 
the leading zero for the date and for the time, or else the order would not 
work properly. The order is based on the key, which in this case, is time. 
Thus, not displaying the leading zero would cause a time of 9:00 am to be 
placed above a time of 11:00 am on the same day. To fix this, I displayed the 
leading zero, so that 09:00 am is placed below 11:00 am on the same day.
