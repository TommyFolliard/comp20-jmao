1. What is this course

COMP20 is a web programming course that teaches programming on the web, 
both on the client side and the server side.

2. What was your favorite project
Frogger was by far my favorite project because it was a game I could play. 
I never thought I would be able to create a game actually playable on the web. 

3. Project most proud of
I am most proud of my scorecenter project because it was by far the project 
I spent the most time on. It took me a very long time to understand what exactly 
I was supposed to do in the project. But after finishing the project and getting it 
to work, I am very glad that the project turned out the way I wanted to.

4. How much you have learned
I have grown so much as a programmer in this course. As a freshman, in all the 
courses I have taken so far, this course is the most applicable to the real world. When I 
look back upon the course, COMP20 is definitely my favorite course I have taken at Tufts 
so far. I like how everything on the web is something you can see, unlike in COMP11 and COMP15 
where not everything is viewable to the implementer, with the exception of error messages. The most 
important thing I learned in this course is that everything is somewhat related to another. For example, 
the DOM lab working with status updates was revisited when working with cookies and local storage. Another 
example was the frogger game revisited when working with scorecenter.
